# Unit 16 Project 2 Homework: Professional Materials
Now that you've built a full-stack web application and have another project to share, you'll be updating your portfolio page and other materials to build toward being employer competitive.
If you are opting out of career services, this is still a required assignment. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is necessary if you're applying for jobs, but is still critical on your journey as a developer.

# Requirements


Updated portfolio featuring projects 1 and 2 and at least four exemplary homework assignments.


Update GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring projects 1 and 2 and four exemplary assignments.


Updated resume


Updated LinkedIn profile
